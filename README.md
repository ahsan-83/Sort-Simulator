OS must be included in C:/Windows/System32 and C:/Windows/SysWOW64 folder which files are attached in Sort_Lib/DLL_32/ folder
and Sort_Lib/DLL_64/ folder. From these two folder msvcr110d.dll must be copied and pasted in to 
C:/Windows/System32 and C:/Windows/SysWOW64 folder before running the Sorting_Algo_Simulation.exe file.

Total visual studio project is also attached in Sorting_Algo_Simulation_Project_File folder.

Sort Simulator is Structured Programming LAB Project of BUET CSE Level-1 term-2.
Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Quick sort algoritm steps are simulated for small scale input.
Simulator is developed using C++ and iGraphics library in Visual Studio.
